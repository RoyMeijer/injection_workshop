# SQL Injection Workshop

This repository contains resources from my workshop on understanding and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. The workshop aims to educate participants on the risks and mitigation strategies associated with SQL injection.

## Overview

SQL injection is a prevalent and hazardous web security vulnerability. It allows attackers to manipulate the queries an application makes to its database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation. This workshop provides practical insights into how SQL injection occurs and how developers can safeguard their applications against it.

## Vulnerability Explained

The workshop includes a demonstration of a typical SQL injection vulnerability within a web application. It showcases how constructing SQL queries by concatenating user inputs can lead to exploitable security flaws.

## Preventing SQL Injection

Key strategies to prevent SQL injection are discussed, including:

- **Use of Parameterized Queries:** Ensuring that SQL queries are structured in a way that separates SQL code from user inputs.
- **Employing an ORM Framework:** Utilizing Object-Relational Mapping tools to handle database interactions more securely.
- **Regular Database Management System Updates:** Keeping database systems and frameworks up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.
